With the latest fuel shortages gripping the UK perhaps you’ve decided to invest in an electric vehicle (EV) or maybe you already own an EV and are currently feeling very smug indeed. Whatever your position you will probably find that locating a public charging point is still not the easiest thing to do as the current charging infrastructure lags far behind that of its petrol powered equivalent.

To help you find your next charge we’ve recently launched our EV Chargers API where you can search for EV chargers by simple location based search using geographic coordinates or a bounding box. There’s also support for filters like charging speed so you can quickly find those 50KW fast chargers. See the API page at https://m3o.com/evchargers for more details.

For those Nocode developers out there we’ve also released a [Bubble plugin](https://bubble.io/plugin/micro-ev-chargers-1633095409736x923914890066526200) so you can quickly add EV Charger search to your apps. You can see a demo of this in action at https://evchargers-tester.bubbleapps.io/version-test
