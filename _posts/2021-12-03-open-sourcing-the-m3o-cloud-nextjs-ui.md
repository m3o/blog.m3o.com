## TLDR

M3O is a next generation cloud platform. We offer public APIs as simpler programmable building blocks 
for a 10x developer experience. We believe in an open source first strategy and so today we're 
unveiling the Next.js version of our website. Anyone can download, self host and even contribute 
back.
